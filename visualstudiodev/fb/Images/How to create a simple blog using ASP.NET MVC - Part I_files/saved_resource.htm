<p>I followed all the steps and I found one bug. On the home page pressing next and previous works perfectly same with if you search something. However when I click on a tag such as Csharp which has more than 10 records and then click next. The url sends /Category?p=2 leading to an error. Was wondering if you would be able to take a look at it. I believe the bug is in _Pager.cshtml because thats where I hardcoded a way to fix it. I would like to know how you would fix it as you created the blog code thus understanding it better than me. Thanks</p>

<p>I couldn't able to reproduce the issue in the completed source-code, so I need your help. Are you sure when you click a tag it goes to url "/Category?p=2"? Because it supposed to go "/Tag/tag_name?p=2". Also, what fix you've done in _Pager.cshtml to resolve this issue? Can you provide some more information?</p>

<p>From what you are saying I think I see where the error is from. You said the link should be "/Tag/tag_name" when you click on a tag while on my code it shows as "/Tag?tag=tag_name". I have no idea why though.</p><p>edit: Seems like I figured it out. In routeConfig.cs I had</p><p>routes.MapRoute(<br>    "Action",<br>    "{action}",<br>    new { controller = "Blog", action = "Posts" }<br>);</p><p>written at the top so it had priority over all the other routes.MapRoute including the tag and category one. Thanks for the telling me how the link should have looked, it really helped me out.</p>

<p>First of all great article. Thanks for sparing time for writing step by step instructions. Its very helpful for anyone like me who is new to MVC.</p><p>I am going through your article to build the blog myself for the purpose of learning. I have come across one issue so far. Not sure if someone else has already highlighted it or not.</p><p>It seems Take and Skip do not work correctly with FetchMany. When you are fetching 10 records by using .Take(pageSize), it is affecting FetchMany results as well and does not return more than 10 tags.</p><p>I tried searching the solution over the internet and found following link which has worked for me.</p><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9729262/nhibernate-linq-provider-and-take-skip-with-eager-fetching" rel="nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/quest...</a></p>

<p>kernel.Load(new RepositoryModule());<br>I'm getting error in this line. It does not match the best overload. Other examples have used<br>kernel.Load(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());<br>but I'm not sure if this would work in JustBlog as RepositoryModule class is created in the Core class library. Please help me understand this.<br>Thanks,<br>Pulkit Gulati</p>

<p>Hi Vijaya!</p><p>This looks like a fantastic tutorial/walk through! I'm a little lost in part 1 page 5 story 5 where you direct us to "Remove the NinjectWebCommon.cs file from the App_Start folder and derive our global application class from NinjectHttpApplication class and override the CreateKernel method". I've installed ninect.mvc3 and I've removed the additional file from App Start. However I can't seem to find NinjectHttpApplication in my project anywhere and my Global.asax files looks pretty standard and is very short.</p><p>Is there anyway you could provide a little more guidance here? Do we need to create a class ourselves called NinjectHttpApplication? I also don't see the CreateKernel method anywhere either. Tried seaching the solution explorer for it with no success. Perhaps I installed the Ninject.MV3 incorrectly?</p><p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>Hey Vijaya,</p><p>Thanks for the super quick reply! I also took a look at the code on your githuub account (specifically at global.asax and global.asax.cs) and did some reading on code behind and I believe I understand now!</p><p>Thanks again for the reply/help AND for taking the time out to write this tutorial!</p><p>Best,<br>Cameron</p>

<p>Hi Vijaya, I'm quite new to all this. I have lots of questions, for example, do i need to create mapping classes in EF, i checked few tutorials online, nobody has created separate mapping classes, may be there is no need in code first migration.

<p>You don't need separate mapping classes. You've do that mapping in the derived db context (let say BlogDbContext) class as show in this article <a href="http://www.dotnetcurry.com/showarticle.aspx?ID=899" rel="nofollow">http://www.dotnetcurry.com/sho...</a>.</p><p>The EF repository implementation (let say EFBlogRepository implements IBlogRepository) needs BlogDbContext in it's constructor. For injecting BlogDbContext, we've to set it's bindings and we can do that in the RepositoryModule class.</p><p>Actually RepositoryModule class is not at all required if you are going to do all the binding work in the JustBlog MVC project but in that case the project needs dependency with EntityFramework dll which may not be a good idea. At the time of writing this... I'm working on implementing the EFBlogRepository class (atleast some methods) and hopefully I'll complete by today and share you.</p>
